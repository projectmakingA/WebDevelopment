**Project: Development of User Authentication System**

**Company 'X' Project Overview:**
The company 'X' is developing a web application and needs help with user authentication for students and teachers. They have approached our CSE section to solve this issue. The project aims to implement a user authentication system (signup, login, and logout) using suitable tech stacks.

**Learning Objectives:**

* Understand the principles and importance of user authentication.
* Develop skills in front-end and back-end technologies.
* Learn how to securely handle user data.
* Gain experience in integrating front-end and back-end        systems.
* Implement security best practices and validation techniques.

**Prerequisites:**
Front-end: HTML form elements, CSS styling, JavaScript.
Back-end: Node.js, Django, Flask (choose based on your skill set).

**Implementation Steps:**
* Student Registration Page:
Form fields: First Name, Last Name, Username (ID), Password, Email.
* Teacher Registration Page:
Form fields: Name, Subject, Department, Username (EmpID), Password, Email.
* Student Sign-in Page:
Form fields: Username (ID), Password.
* Teacher Sign-in Page:
Form fields: Username (EmpID), Password.
* Logout Page:
Implement logout functionality for both students and teachers.
* Backend Storage:
Ensure all user data is securely stored in the backend.

Include test cases to validate user credentials, ensure usernames are registered before login, and verify password matches.

**Divide the team into two parts**: one for front-end and one for back-end development.
Focus on the area of your interest (front-end or back-end).
After completing individual parts, integrate them to achieve the final product.
The project can also be done entirely with front-end technologies if preferred.
Use your own methods and styling to complete the work.

****Project Completion:****
The project is considered complete when it meets all the implementation requirements and addresses the problem statement.
Let's work individually or together to achieve this goal!
